# Havatime
HavaTime is an Android application that helps people to pick the best shuttle time to go to the airports in Istanbul. It uses 
Google Distance Matrix APIs to make the best guesses.

The application suggests the user three shuttles with their risk of missing the flight over 100. Risk is obtained by first calculating the
time user will have at the airport and then it is proportioned with the constants as maximum time at the airport and minimum time
at the airport.
